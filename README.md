Noell: I added a health and hunger bar to Selina's player. The hunger bar decreases over time and the speed of which it needs to decrease can be modified. 
The bars fills' decrease if the health/hunger decreases. I've never made any kind of bars before so that was quite interesting. I fought with unity for a while over the squares,
that I used for the bars. It ended up being okay. I opted for going for no background on the bars to keep a very clean look, it is still not final though!


Matti: I made 3 AI animals, these are friendly AI's and there primary focus is to just make the world more alive.
The Friendly AI are state based with different factors that decide which state they will be in. 
Idle and jumping, if there is no one around it will sometimes jump or be idle
it will sometimes walk to different random destinations. If an enemy is near it will run away.
There are different animations connected to the script with a method that handles animation, that makes the booleans true and make the animations start.
I have made the dog AI script different than the penguin and chicken because i plan to make it somehow be more connected to the player later.
I plan to make an enemy AI to give a challenge to the player.
