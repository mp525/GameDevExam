Noell: I added a health and hunger bar to Selina's player. The hunger bar decreases over time and the speed of which it needs to decrease can be modified. 
The bars fills' decrease if the health/hunger decreases. I've never made any kind of bars before so that was quite interesting. I fought with unity for a while over the squares,
that I used for the bars. It ended up being okay. I opted for going for no background on the bars to keep a very clean look, it is still not final though!
